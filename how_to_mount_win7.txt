The very first time

Step 1

docker-machine stop (if running)
open virtualbox/setting/Shared Folder/press Plus to add new shared folder
From Folder Path select the real folder on local computer
Give it a name, e.g. "learn_spark"
At Mount point write a folder in Linux system, e.g. /home/docker/projects
Click OK to add the shared folder

Step 2

docker-machine start
ssh into the virtual machine: docker-machine ssh
check where are you standing: pwd (it should be /home/docker/)
Create a folder: mkdir projects
get out of the virtual machine by typing "exit"


Step 3:
Run this command:
docker run -it -v /home/docker/projects:/home/jovyan/work -p 8888:8888 jupyter/pyspark-notebook
